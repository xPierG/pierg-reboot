Deep down, I'm a software engineer. This shapes how I lead innovation, AI, and digital transformation: my work is about turning strategy into results... one at a time, bridging the gap between a great idea and working tech through agile, hands-on execution.

My career has been a bit of a wild ride, from the pit lanes of Ferrari F1 to the roaring engines at Ducati. Today, as Chief Innovation and Data Officer at Credem Bank, I'm bringing that same speed and innovation mindset to finance. My journey started by cutting my teeth in tech consulting and slinging code at Elsag, a former Finmeccanica company.

My approach is hands-on. I'm less interested in buzzwords and more focused on applying emerging tech like AI and agile methods to build things that actually work.

When I'm not at the bank, I'm still building. I co-founded ImpactHub Reggio Emilia and love jumping into the trenches with tech startups. You'll also find me on conference stages or in university halls, talking (probably too much) about AI, digital strategy, and agile.

My goal is simple: challenge the status quo and build what's next.
