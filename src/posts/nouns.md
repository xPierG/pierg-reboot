This week I had the chance to listen to Prof.Vignoli of “Università di Modena e Reggio Emilia” talking about [Design Thinking – Stanford d.school](http://dschool.stanford.edu/our-point-of-view/) (+ something more 🙂 ).

One thing that I took with me from the speech is that:

    “user’s need are verbs and not nouns”

Let me explain that: when you have to **understand people’s needs**, because you have to design something to service them, ask them to **describe the need as a verb**.

So I don’t need a STAIR (noun), a **stair is a already a solution**, “I need **to go up** (verb) to …” .
Got it?

I give you an extra tip for free 🙂 : the most the description of the need is ‘open’ (= less constraints, more general), the highes is the number of innovative options you can get back.
