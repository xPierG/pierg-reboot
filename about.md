## Chi sono

At my core, I am a software developer by design. I lead innovation and digital transformation initiatives, building my career at the intersection of strategy, technology, and agile execution.

My work is about driving change. I currently serve as Chief Innovation Officer at Credem Bank, following an exciting role as Chief Information and Digital Transformation Officer at Ducati and a long experience with Ferrari F1. My journey also includes significant experience in tech consulting with Iconsulting.

My approach is hands-on, rooted in a deep technical background and focused on applying emerging technologies like AI and agile practices (SCRUM) to solve real-world business problems.

Beyond my corporate roles, I am deeply involved in the innovation ecosystem. I'm a co-founder of ImpactHub Reggio Emilia and have been involved with several tech startups. I frequently speak at conferences and lecture at universities, sharing insights on AI, digital strategy, and agile methodologies.

My goal is simple: to continuously challenge the status quo and build what's next.
